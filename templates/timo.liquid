					<blockquote>One of the most exciting developments of our 2014-2015 season is Tertulia's composer "in residence" Timo Andres. Timo is a truly globe-trotting New York composer whose music looks back on a distinctively 20th Century American style of classical music, while driving forward a contemporary and innovative 21st Century musical language. He is involved with projects ranging from commissions by the most celebrated venues for traditional classical music, to the so-called "indie classical" group of composers and performers who blur distinctions between pop and art music (we look forward to Timo's concert with celebrated, multi-genre vocalist Becca Stevens on Copland's Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson on February 23rd), to collaborations with essential jazz musicians like Brad Mehldau. Timo maintains a lively blog on his website and has a keen eye for design. He possesses an enviable curiosity for the arts and letters both of our time and of the past. And did we mention he is delightful to be around? The musicians at Tertulia share the same love of food, drink, music and community as our audiences - chamber music, after all, involves everyone in the room, not just the performers - and we are so happy to have a composer, performer and creative force like Timo who shares our passion. We are thrilled to welcome Timo to Tertulia this season.<cite>James Austin Smith, Co-Artistic Director</cite></blockquote>

					<p class="large">Timo Andres (b. 1985, Palo Alto, CA) is a composer and pianist who grew up in rural Connecticut and now lives in Brooklyn, NY. His debut album, <em>Shy and Mighty</em>, which features ten interrelated pieces for two pianos performed by himself and pianist David Kaplan, was released by Nonesuch Records in May 2010 to immediate critical acclaim. Of the disc, Alex Ross wrote in <em>The New Yorker</em> that <em>Shy and Mighty</em> "achieves an unhurried grandeur that has rarely been felt in American music since John Adams came on the scene... more mighty than shy, [Andres] sounds like himself."</p>
					<p class="large">Timo's new works include a piano quintet for Jonathan Biss and the Elias String Quartet, commissioned and presented by Wigmore Hall, Carnegie Hall, the Concertgebouw Amsterdam and San Francisco Performances; a solo piano work for Kirill Gerstein, commissioned by the Gilmore Foundation; a new string quartet for the Library of Congress, premiered by the Attacca Quartet; and a new piece for yMusic. Upcoming commissions include a major work for Third Coast Percussion and an ensemble song cycle to be premiered by himself, Gabriel Kahane, Becca Stevens, Ted Hearne and Nathan Koci at the Ecstatic Music Festival, and presented by the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra's Liquid Music series. <a href="http://andres.com" target="_blank">read more &raquo;</a></p>
